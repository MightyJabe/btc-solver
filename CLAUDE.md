## High-Level Architecture

### Core Components

**kangaroo-sota (RCKangaroo - Primary Implementation)**
- `RCKangaroo.cpp` - Main SOTA algorithm implementation (K=1.15)
- `RCGpuCore.cu` - Optimized GPU kernels with 3-kernel pipeline
- `GpuKang.cpp/h` - GPU management and memory handling
- `Ec.cpp/h` - Elliptic curve operations
- **Advantages**: 2x faster, supports 170-bit ranges, modern GPU optimization

**kangaroo-classic (Reference Implementation)**
- `Kangaroo.cpp` - Traditional algorithm (K=2.1)
- `SECPK1/Int.h` - 256-bit integer arithmetic
- `GPU/GPUEngine.cu` - Single kernel GPU implementation
- `HashTable.cpp` - Distinguished point collision detection
- **Note**: Works with 135-bit despite 125-bit documentation

### Algorithm Architecture

**Pollard's Kangaroo Method**
- Uses "tame" and "wild" kangaroo herds that perform random walks
- Collision detection via distinguished points (points with specific bit patterns)
- Square root complexity: ~2^(n/2) operations for n-bit range
- **Critical**: Range width determines computational complexity, not absolute values

**Data Flow**
1. Range initialization and validation (`Kangaroo::InitRange()`)
2. Kangaroo creation and distribution across CPU/GPU threads
3. Random walk execution with jump table
4. Distinguished point detection and storage in hash table
5. Collision detection between tame/wild kangaroos
6. Private key reconstruction from collision data

### Phase 2 Modifications Target Areas

**Range Validation System** (`Kangaroo.cpp`)
- Add explicit range width validation (currently missing)
- Implement smart timeout mechanisms for large ranges
- Add performance monitoring and progress reporting

**Memory Management** (`Int.h`, `HashTable.cpp`)
- Optimize for 135-bit ranges within 256-bit integer constraints
- Implement dynamic memory allocation based on range size
- Add memory usage monitoring and limits

**GPU Optimization** (`GPU/GPUEngine.cu`)
- Extend GPU kernels for efficient 135-bit integer operations
- Optimize memory transfers and grid configurations
- Add GPU memory management for larger ranges

## Development Workflow

### Phase 2 Implementation Process
1. **Baseline Testing**: Create and run 119/125/130/135-bit test configurations
2. **Code Analysis**: Identify bottlenecks in `InitRange()`, integer operations, and GPU kernels
3. **Implementation**: Add range validation, timeout systems, and algorithm optimizations
4. **Validation**: Ensure no regression in existing performance while extending capability

### Performance Baselines (RTX 3070)
- **kangaroo-classic CPU**: 14 MK/s 
- **kangaroo-classic GPU**: 1000-1100 MK/s
- **kangaroo-sota GPU**: 2000-2200 MK/s (2x improvement) ‚≠ê
- **Target**: 5000-10000 MK/s through optimization and distribution

### Benchmark Results Location
- **Baseline logs**: `results/benchmarks/`
- **Test configurations**: `tests/configs/`
- **Comparison scripts**: `tools/testing/`

## Important Notes

### Security Context
This is a defensive security research project focused on understanding cryptographic strength limits. The tools are used for:
- Academic research on elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem
- Recovery of lost cryptocurrency wallets (with proper ownership)
- Security analysis of cryptographic implementations

### Performance Achievements
- **2x Performance**: RCKangaroo (kangaroo-sota) validated at 2000+ MK/s
- **Extended Range**: kangaroo-sota supports up to 170-bit ranges natively
- **125-bit Limitation**: Only applies to kangaroo-classic documentation; both implementations work with 135-bit ranges

### Algorithm Efficiency
- **Traditional Kangaroo (K=2.1)**: ~2^68.6 operations for 135-bit
- **SOTA Method (K=1.15)**: ~2^67.7 operations for 135-bit
- **Combined Improvement**: 1.8x fewer operations √ó 2x implementation speed = 3.6x total improvement

### Performance Scaling
The algorithm has square root complexity, meaning each additional bit doubles the computational requirement. However, the SOTA implementation's efficiency gains significantly reduce the practical impact.
